# NFC 2 BLE
Is a small software that reads and RFID chip and forwards the UID by emulating an bluetooth keyboard (HID).

This allows for simple RFID scans to many hardware as tablets or laptops.

## Hardware
- ESP32
- PN532 (or similar)

## Circuit Diagram
![circuit diagram](circuit_diagram.png "circuit diagram")

| ESP32 | PN532 |
|-------|-------|
| D22   | SCL   |
| D21   | SDA   |
| GND   | GND   |
| 3,3V  | VCC   |

Add 2 pull-up resistors of 3,3kÎ© between VCC and both I2C lines.

## Compile
To compile this I used [Platform.io](https://platformio.org/)
